# AWS Workload Account Setup

This repo contains a Terraform module that is part of the tooling to provision a project team's accounts within an AWS Landing Zone.

This module is used in conjunction with other modules that provide other "layers" to project accounts within a landing zone.  The modules are orchestrated using a `terragrunt` configuration that is contained in a private repository.

# How To Use

Note: This module is intended to be used by another "root" module, or as part of a `terragrunt` "stack" rather than on its own.  It doesn't do much on its own.
